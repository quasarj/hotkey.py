# hotpy
Python module for easily binding hotkeys in Windows.

There are a few other libraries out there that do this, but none of them seem to work with Python 3.4+, so hotpy was born.

The idea and a portion of the code came from https://github.com/schurpf/pyhk

# Requirements
* Python 3.x (only tested on 3.4+)
* py32win
